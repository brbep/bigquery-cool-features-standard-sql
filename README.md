# Cool Bigquery Features Using Standard SQL
There are several cool features in BigQuery that we can use via standard SQL query syntax, often unknown to even the most frequent users. This document intends to show some of them, not being an exhaustive work.

There is no logical order for the topics to follow, just a collection of a few features/functions that I find interesting.

All this content and many others can be found in the [Bigquery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference).

## Assumptions before you begin
* You will need to have a Google Cloud account. If not, you can create it from [here](https://cloud.google.com/free). Click on *Get Started for Free* button which appears on the top right corner.
* For some examples, you will need to have a Bigquery project ([see documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)) and permissions to edit tables and access data.
